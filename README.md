Hey! This is a coding exersize for myself.
I used Deepseek ai to get me started with a very basic adventure game. 
From there I have a fun toy to expand on myself as a learning project. 

prompt I started with
write a minimalistic text adventure game 
in which the player is an artist with a crumbled art career 
in the context of a crumbled art scene 
in a crubled dutch coastal city.

Expansion:
I added more attributes to the player.
